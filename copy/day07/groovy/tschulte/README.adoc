== Amplification Circuit

For this days task I just copied the sollution from day 9 (since I solved that day first) and altered the `computeOutput` method to allow multiple inputs for opcode 3.

.computeOutput
[source]
....
include::day07.groovy[tags=computeOutput]
....

.First Star
[source]
....
include::day07.groovy[tags=maxThrusterSignal]
include::day07.groovy[tags=starOne]
....

I was not able to solve the second star yet. The following does not work.

.Second Star
[source]
....
include::day07.groovy[tags=maxThrusterSignalFeedbackLoop]
include::day07.groovy[tags=starTwo]
....
