== Space Stoichiometry

=== Part 1

This was relatively easy and I was number 996 to get Star 1.

=== Part 2

This took a little longer.
I had a mistake and it ran very long.
Then I thought there was some trick to it.
This led me astray for a while until I found the mistake and saw the straight forward solution doesn't run that long.

I did add some optimisation to reduce the time.
