== Space Stoichiometry

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

Part 1 ended up being pretty tricky since you can have excess resources after a
reaction, but basically recurses down to get the amount of ore needed for each
element and as it does so, keeps track of the excess items.

Part 2 was pretty simple after that, doing a simple binary search to find the
max amount of fuel you can produce with a given amount of ore.
