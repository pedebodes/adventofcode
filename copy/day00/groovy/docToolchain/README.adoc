== Hello World

This solution is written in Groovy.

I will use my helper to read the input from a file:

[source, groovy, numbered]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=helper]
....

=== First Star

The solutions shall print out a greeting.
I will wrap this in a simple `helloWorld` method.

[source, groovy, numbered]
....
include::solution.groovy[tags=starOne,!starTwo]
....

<1> this is where I call the helper method to read my input

[plantuml]
----
file input.txt
component readInput
component helloWorld
helloWorld -> readInput : calls
readInput -> input.txt : reads file
----

=== Second Star

There is no second star.
