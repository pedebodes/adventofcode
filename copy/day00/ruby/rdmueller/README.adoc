This year, I wil luse Advent of Code to learn ruby.
The reason is simple.
I don't know ruby yet and Asciidoctor, the converter for AsciiDoc, is written in ruby.
So this knowledge should help me to make better use of Asciidoctor.

What I've found to get started with ruby are the http://rubykoans.com/[ruby koans].
Programming koans are simply put just a bunch of unit tests which you have to fix to get them to pass.
This way, you also learn the language they are written in.
You also learn how to write tests in the given language which gives you a good start because you can do test driven development right from the start!

A second goal for this year it to use documentation driven development/design (DDD/D) ðŸ¤£.
With this approach, I first write my thoughts down as documentation and then start to code.

While I write the docs, I will already decided about classes and methods I need.
I will already add them to the docs as references to the code.

Next I will turn my thoughts into test driven development (TDD).
As soon as I know what I want to code, I can already write some acceptance criteria and then some tests.
These tests can also be referenced from the docs.

Now let's start with the simple `hello world`:

.solution.rb
[source, ruby]
----
include::solution.rb[]
----

Acceptance criteria is that the code returns the text "Hello World" when executed.
Let's write the tests as bash script :-)

.tests.bash
[source, bash]
----
include::test.bash[]
----

.results.txt
[source, text]
----
include::results.txt[]
----
