== Oxygen System

The solutions are written in Typescript. To run them use the following commands.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution2.js
....

The core Algorithmus is starting from given position and get candidates which are not visited
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/Panel.ts[tag=getCandidates]
....

With candidates that are not walls search for next candidates.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
 coordinates = candidates
                    .filter(item => item.t == 1)
                    .map((o : any ) =>  {return { x : o.x, y : o.y , w : o.w }});
....

=== First Start

Solved by finding nearest (from 0,0) unvisited field und tile computer return 2. 
Then get length of shortest path from this point to 0,0

=== Second Star

Solved by create map until no "no visited" filed exists. Then calculate maximal length from oxygen system to each point in the map.
