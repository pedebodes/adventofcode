== Oxygen System

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

I used the same function for both part 1 and part 2. First I found all of the
points on the grid using a breadth first search on the given intcode program.
Then I used breadth first search again to find the maximum empty space away from
the found oxygen tank.
